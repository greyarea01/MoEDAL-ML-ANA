# dataset_tools

Tools for image processing and dataset creation for MoEDAL ML RnD study

Derived from minihip framework for MoEDAL ntd RnD analysis (l.millward@qmul.ac.uk)
Inspired by Hipster framework for MoEDAL ntd analysis (a.j.bevan@qmul.ac.uk et al)


1) file converter (generate single folder pngs from raw tga output)
2) coordinates - coordinate transformations, and coordinate system
3) plotting - some basic plotting options
4) image tools, pit ID in clean foils, X,Y locations, and microscope slide data-handler
5) mhio, minihip input output - wrapper to picke and json dumps / loads
